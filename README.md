## Background

To thank our Open Source colleagues and community for the great collaboration
in 2022, we worked on a sweet surprise and designed three exclusive praliné
creations.

The three varieties reflect our three international teams and each combine a
local specialty with the finest Swiss chocolate.

All pralinés will be available from mid-December 2022. As Adfinis is committed
to quality and openness, the pralinés are of course handmade - exclusively by
the Swiss management team and the recipes are freely available in this
repository.

You also want one of the exclusive packages? Write us a mail to
